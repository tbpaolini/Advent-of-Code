<h2>--- Day 20: Donut Maze ---</h2><p>You notice a strange pattern on the surface of Pluto and land nearby to get a closer look. Upon closer inspection, you realize you've come across one of the famous space-warping mazes of the long-lost Pluto civilization!</p>
<p>Because there isn't much space on Pluto, the civilization that used to live here thrived by inventing a method for folding spacetime.  Although the technology is no longer understood, mazes like this one provide a small glimpse into the <span title="So really, this puzzle is more archaeology than math, right?">daily life of an ancient Pluto citizen</span>.</p>
<p>This maze is shaped like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">donut</a>. Portals along the inner and outer edge of the donut can instantly teleport you from one side to the other.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>         A           
         A           
  #######.#########  
  #######.........#  
  #######.#######.#  
  #######.#######.#  
  #######.#######.#  
  #####  B    ###.#  
BC...##  C    ###.#  
  ##.##       ###.#  
  ##...DE  F  ###.#  
  #####    G  ###.#  
  #########.#####.#  
DE..#######...###.#  
  #.#########.###.#  
FG..#########.....#  
  ###########.#####  
             Z       
             Z       
</code></pre>
<p>This map of the maze shows solid walls (<code>#</code>) and open passages (<code>.</code>). Every maze on Pluto has a start (the open tile next to <code>AA</code>) and an end (the open tile next to <code>ZZ</code>). Mazes on Pluto also have portals; this maze has three pairs of portals: <code>BC</code>, <code>DE</code>, and <code>FG</code>. When on an open tile next to one of these labels, a single step can take you to the other tile with the same label. (You can only walk on <code>.</code> tiles; labels and empty space are not traversable.)</p>
<p>One path through the maze doesn't require any portals.  Starting at <code>AA</code>, you could go down 1, right 8, down 12, left 4, and down 1 to reach <code>ZZ</code>, a total of 26 steps.</p>
<p>However, there is a shorter path:  You could walk from <code>AA</code> to the inner <code>BC</code> portal (4 steps), warp to the outer <code>BC</code> portal (1 step), walk to the inner <code>DE</code> (6 steps), warp to the outer <code>DE</code> (1 step), walk to the outer <code>FG</code> (4 steps), warp to the inner <code>FG</code> (1 step), and finally walk to <code>ZZ</code> (6 steps). In total, this is only <em>23</em> steps.</p>
<p>Here is a larger example:</p>

<p>Here, <code>AA</code> has no direct path to <code>ZZ</code>, but it does connect to <code>AS</code> and <code>CP</code>. By passing through <code>AS</code>, <code>QG</code>, <code>BU</code>, and <code>JO</code>, you can reach <code>ZZ</code> in <em>58</em> steps.</p>
<p>In your maze, <em>how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked <code>AA</code> to the open tile marked <code>ZZ</code>?</em></p>
