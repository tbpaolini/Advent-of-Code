<h2>--- Day 13: Care Package ---</h2><p>As you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail Indicator Light is blinking.  To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package.</p>
<p>It's a new game for the ship's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet">arcade cabinet</a>! Unfortunately, the arcade is <em>all the way</em> on the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be hard to build your own - the care package even comes with schematics.</p>
<p>The arcade cabinet runs <a href="9">Intcode</a> software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square <em>tiles</em> on a grid.  The software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions: every three output instructions specify the <code>x</code> position (distance from the left), <code>y</code> position (distance from the top), and <code>tile id</code>. The <code>tile id</code> is interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> is an <em>empty</em> tile.  No game object appears in this tile.</li>
<li><code>1</code> is a <em>wall</em> tile.  Walls are indestructible barriers.</li>
<li><code>2</code> is a <em>block</em> tile.  Blocks can be broken by the ball.</li>
<li><code>3</code> is a <em>horizontal paddle</em> tile.  The paddle is indestructible.</li>
<li><code>4</code> is a <em>ball</em> tile.  The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a sequence of output values like <code>1,2,3,6,5,4</code> would draw a <em>horizontal paddle</em> tile (<code>1</code> tile from the left and <code>2</code> tiles from the top) and a <em>ball</em> tile (<code>6</code> tiles from the left and <code>5</code> tiles from the top).</p>
<p>Start the game. <em>How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits?</em></p>
