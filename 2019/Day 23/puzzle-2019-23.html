<h2>--- Day 23: Category Six ---</h2><p>The droids have finished repairing as much of the ship as they can.  Their <span title="If you don't at least exhale sharply through your nose after reading this joke, we probably can't be friends.">report</span> indicates that this was a <em>Category 6</em> disaster - not because it was that bad, but because it destroyed the stockpile of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_6_cable">Category 6</a> network cables as well as most of the ship's network infrastructure.</p>
<p>You'll need to <em>rebuild the network from scratch</em>.</p>
<p>The computers on the network are standard <a href="9">Intcode</a> computers that communicate by sending <em>packets</em> to each other.  There are <code>50</code> of them in total, each running a copy of the same <em>Network Interface Controller</em> (NIC) software (your puzzle input). The computers have <em>network addresses</em> <code>0</code> through <code>49</code>; when each computer boots up, it will request its network address via a single input instruction. Be sure to give each computer a unique network address.</p>
<p>Once a computer has received its network address, it will begin doing work and communicating over the network by sending and receiving <em>packets</em>. All packets contain <em>two values</em> named <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. Packets sent to a computer are queued by the recipient and read in the order they are received.</p>
<p>To <em>send</em> a packet to another computer, the NIC will use <em>three output instructions</em> that provide the <em>destination address</em> of the packet followed by its <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> values.  For example, three output instructions that provide the values <code>10</code>, <code>20</code>, <code>30</code> would send a packet with <code>X=20</code> and <code>Y=30</code> to the computer with address <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>To <em>receive</em> a packet from another computer, the NIC will use an <em>input instruction</em>.  If the incoming packet queue is <em>empty</em>, provide <code>-1</code>.  Otherwise, provide the <code>X</code> value of the next packet; the computer will then use a second input instruction to receive the <code>Y</code> value for the same packet.  Once both values of the packet are read in this way, the packet is removed from the queue.</p>
<p>Note that these input and output instructions never <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(computing)">block</a>. Specifically, output instructions do not wait for the sent packet to be received - the computer might send multiple packets before receiving any. Similarly, input instructions do not wait for a packet to arrive - if no packet is waiting, input instructions should receive <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>Boot up all <code>50</code> computers and attach them to your network.  <em>What is the <code>Y</code> value of the first packet sent to address <code>255</code>?</em></p>
