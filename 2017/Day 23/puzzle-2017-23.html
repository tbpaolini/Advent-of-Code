<h2>--- Day 23: Coprocessor Conflagration ---</h2><p>You decide to head directly to the CPU and fix the printer from there. As you get close, you find an <em>experimental coprocessor</em> doing so much work that the local programs are afraid it will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire">halt and catch fire</a>. This would cause serious issues for the rest of the computer, so you head in and see what you can do.</p>
<p>The code it's running seems to be a variant of the kind you saw recently on that <a href="18">tablet</a>. The general functionality seems <em>very similar</em>, but some of the instructions are different:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set X Y</code> <em>sets</em> register <code>X</code> to the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
<li><code>sub X Y</code> <em>decreases</em> register <code>X</code> by the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
<li><code>mul X Y</code> sets register <code>X</code> to the result of <em>multiplying</em> the value contained in register <code>X</code> by the value of <code>Y</code>.</li>
<li><code>jnz X Y</code> <em>jumps</em> with an offset of the value of <code>Y</code>, but only if the value of <code>X</code> is <em>not zero</em>. (An offset of <code>2</code> skips the next instruction, an offset of <code>-1</code> jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)</li>
<p>Only the instructions listed above are used. The eight registers here, named <code>a</code> through <code>h</code>, all start at <code>0</code>.</p>
</ul>
<p>The coprocessor is currently set to some kind of <em>debug mode</em>, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.</p>
<p>If you run the program (your puzzle input), <em>how many times is the <code>mul</code> instruction invoked?</em></p>
