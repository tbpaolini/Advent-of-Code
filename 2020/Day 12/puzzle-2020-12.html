<h2>--- Day 12: Rain Risk ---</h2><p>Your ferry made decent progress toward the island, but the storm came in <span title="At least it wasn't a Category Six!">faster than anyone expected</span>. The ferry needs to take <em>evasive actions</em>!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the ship's navigation computer seems to be malfunctioning; rather than giving a route directly to safety, it produced extremely circuitous instructions. When the captain uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system" target="_blank">PA system</a> to ask if anyone can help, you quickly volunteer.</p>
<p>The navigation instructions (your puzzle input) consists of a sequence of single-character <em>actions</em> paired with integer input <em>values</em>. After staring at them for a few minutes, you work out what they probably mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action <em><code>N</code></em> means to move <em>north</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>S</code></em> means to move <em>south</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>E</code></em> means to move <em>east</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>W</code></em> means to move <em>west</em> by the given value.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>L</code></em> means to turn <em>left</em> the given number of degrees.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>R</code></em> means to turn <em>right</em> the given number of degrees.</li>
<li>Action <em><code>F</code></em> means to move <em>forward</em> by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ship starts by facing <em>east</em>. Only the <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> actions change the direction the ship is facing. (That is, if the ship is facing east and the next instruction is <code>N10</code>, the ship would move north 10 units, but would still move east if the following action were <code>F</code>.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>F10
N3
F7
R90
F11
</code></pre>
<p>These instructions would be handled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F10</code> would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to <em>east 10, north 0</em>.</li>
<li><code>N3</code> would move the ship 3 units north to <em>east 10, north 3</em>.</li>
<li><code>F7</code> would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>
<li><code>R90</code> would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face <em>south</em>; it remains at <em>east 17, north 3</em>.</li>
<li><code>F11</code> would move the ship 11 units south to <em>east 17, south 8</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of these instructions, the ship's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance" target="_blank">Manhattan distance</a> (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is <code>17 + 8</code> = <em><code>25</code></em>.</p>
<p>Figure out where the navigation instructions lead. <em>What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?</em></p>
