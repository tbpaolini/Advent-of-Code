<h2>--- Day 6: Chronal Coordinates ---</h2><p>The device on your wrist beeps several times, and once again you feel like you're falling.</p>
<p>"<span title="Why is the situation always critical? Why can't the situation just be boring for once?">Situation critical</span>," the device announces. "Destination indeterminate. Chronal interference detected. Please specify new target coordinates."</p>
<p>The device then produces a list of coordinates (your puzzle input). Are they places it thinks are safe or dangerous? It recommends you check manual page 729. The Elves did not give you a manual.</p>
<p><em>If they're dangerous,</em> maybe you can minimize the danger by finding the coordinate that gives the largest distance from the other points.</p>
<p>Using only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan distance</a>, determine the <em>area</em> around each coordinate by counting the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer">integer</a> X,Y locations that are <em>closest</em> to that coordinate (and aren't <em>tied in distance</em> to any other coordinate).</p>
<p>Your goal is to find the size of the <em>largest area</em> that isn't infinite. For example, consider the following list of coordinates:</p>
<pre><code>1, 1
1, 6
8, 3
3, 4
5, 5
8, 9
</code></pre>
<p>If we name these coordinates <code>A</code> through <code>F</code>, we can draw them on a grid, putting <code>0,0</code> at the top left:</p>
<pre><code>..........
.A........
..........
........C.
...D......
.....E....
.B........
..........
..........
........F.
</code></pre>
<p>This view is partial - the actual grid extends infinitely in all directions.  Using the Manhattan distance, each location's closest coordinate can be determined, shown here in lowercase:</p>
<pre><code>aaaaa.cccc
a<em>A</em>aaa.cccc
aaaddecccc
aadddecc<em>C</em>c
..d<em>D</em>deeccc
bb.de<em>E</em>eecc
b<em>B</em>b.eeee..
bbb.eeefff
bbb.eeffff
bbb.ffff<em>F</em>f
</code></pre>
<p>Locations shown as <code>.</code> are equally far from two or more coordinates, and so they don't count as being closest to any.</p>
<p>In this example, the areas of coordinates A, B, C, and F are infinite - while not shown here, their areas extend forever outside the visible grid. However, the areas of coordinates D and E are finite: D is closest to 9 locations, and E is closest to 17 (both including the coordinate's location itself).  Therefore, in this example, the size of the largest area is <em>17</em>.</p>
<p><em>What is the size of the largest area</em> that isn't infinite?</p>
