<h2>--- Day 8: Memory Maneuver ---</h2><p>The sleigh is much easier to pull than you'd expect for something its weight. Unfortunately, neither you nor the Elves know <span title="It's North. Obviously.">which way</span> the North Pole is from here.</p>
<p>You check your wrist device for anything that might help.  It seems to have some kind of navigation system!  Activating the navigation system produces more bad news: "Failed to start navigation system. Could not read software license file."</p>
<p>The navigation system's license file consists of a list of numbers (your puzzle input).  The numbers define a data structure which, when processed, produces some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> that can be used to calculate the license number.</p>
<p>The <em>tree</em> is made up of <em>nodes</em>; a single, outermost node forms the tree's <em>root</em>, and it contains all other nodes in the tree (or contains nodes that contain nodes, and so on).</p>
<p>Specifically, a node consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>header</em>, which is always exactly two numbers:
<ul>
<li>The quantity of child nodes.</li>
<li>The quantity of metadata entries.</li>
</ul>
<li>Zero or more <em>child nodes</em> (as specified in the header).</li>
<li>One or more <em>metadata entries</em> (as specified in the header).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each child node is itself a node that has its own header, child nodes, and metadata. For example:</p>
<pre><code>2 3 0 3 10 11 12 1 1 0 1 99 2 1 1 2
A----------------------------------
    B----------- C-----------
                     D-----
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, each node of the tree is also marked with an underline starting with a letter for easier identification. In it, there are four nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code>, which has <code>2</code> child nodes (<code>B</code>, <code>C</code>) and <code>3</code> metadata entries (<code>1</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>).</li>
<li><code>B</code>, which has <code>0</code> child nodes and <code>3</code> metadata entries (<code>10</code>, <code>11</code>, <code>12</code>).</li>
<li><code>C</code>, which has <code>1</code> child node (<code>D</code>) and <code>1</code> metadata entry (<code>2</code>).</li>
<li><code>D</code>, which has <code>0</code> child nodes and <code>1</code> metadata entry (<code>99</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first check done on the license file is to simply add up all of the metadata entries.  In this example, that sum is <code>1+1+2+10+11+12+2+99=<em>138</em></code>.</p>
<p><em>What is the sum of all metadata entries?</em></p>
